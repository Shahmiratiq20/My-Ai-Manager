## Execution Log
[Iteration 1] ### **Action Plan**
**Task:** Process urgent email from HeyGen about the *Video Agent Challenge* (deadline: Feb 12, 2026).

#### **1. What Needs to Be Done**
- **Identify submission requirements**: Review the video agent challenge details (likely linked in the email) to confirm key steps (e.g., video creation, submission format, deadline).
- **Assess participation status**:
  - If **already working on a submission**, verify progress and note deadlines.
  - If **not yet participating**, evaluate time/resources to join or reply (e.g., "I’m not able to participate this time").
- **Check feasibility**: Confirm if the request aligns with current priorities (e.g., work, personal projects).
- **Reply if needed** (if participation is being requested or no action is required).
- **Archive** after processing.

#### **2. Priority**
- **High**: The challenge is live only on Feb 12, with urgency implied by the "high" priority and past deadline. Likely time-sensitive (e.g., submission window closes soon, or this is a follow-up for missed participants).

#### **3. Next Steps**
- **Now (AI-only)**:
  - Open the email: [webinar@learn.heygen.com](mailto:webinar@learn.heygen.com) → Scan for links or embedded details about the challenge (e.g., FAQs, deadlines, submission guidelines).
  - Extract key submission requirements (format, topic, deadline, etc.).
  - Check if the sender’s email contains a **missed deadline reminder** or **new submission instructions**.
- **Check AI limits**:
  - Can’t create or review videos or submissions **without explicit human approval**.
  - Can’t join/participate in challenges **without confirmation** (e.g., if the task involves signing up for an event or service).
- **If task is simple and can complete now (e.g., no participation needed)**:
  - Draft reply to sender: *"Thank you for the invitation. I’m not participating in the Video Agent Challenge this time."*
  - **Output: <TASK_COMPLETE>** (if no further action is needed).
- **If human involvement is required (e.g., to decide participation or review/submit video)**:
  - Request clarification: *"Is my participation in the Video Agent Challenge expected or optional? If
