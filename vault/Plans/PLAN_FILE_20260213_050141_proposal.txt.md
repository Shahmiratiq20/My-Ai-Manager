# Plan: FILE_20260213_050141_proposal.txt

1. **Action Plan**
   - **What needs to be done:** Verify if `proposal.txt` is empty (size 0 bytes) or if there was a upload error (e.g., missing content, incorrect format).
   - **Priority:** High (pending status indicates potential issue).

2. **Next Steps**
   - **Check file:** Confirm whether `proposal.txt` is intentionally blank or corrupted (e.g., by resending or requesting the sender to re-upload).
   - **Clarify with sender:** If empty, ask for the corrected file or details (e.g., "Did you forget to attach the proposal?").
   - **Log/Alert:** If suspicious, flag the empty file in your system and notify the sender for verification.

3. **Decision Point**
   - If *intentionally empty*: Proceed to step 2 (clarify).
   - If *corrupted/error*: Escalate to IT/file recovery workflow.

**Start with:** *"proposal.txt is empty (0 bytes). Please confirm if this is correct or resend the file."*
