# Plan: EMAIL_20260213_054034

**Action Plan:**

1. **What needs to be done**:
   - Build an agent based on the provided description or task in the Vapi Dashboard.
   - Ensure the agent creation aligns with project goals and works efficiently.

2. **Priority**:
   - **High** (immediate attention required).

3. **Next Steps**:
   - **Log in** to the [Vapi Dashboard](https://app.vapi.ai/) (if not already).
   - **Check the email** under "Inbox" or "Tasks" for full details (e.g., agent requirements, deadlines).
   - **Use Composer** (Vapi’s agent-building tool) to create the agent based on the description.
   - **Test** the agent promptly for functionality and compliance with the request.
   - **Reply** to the sender (Jimmy Chan) with:
     - Agent name/ID and key features.
     - Confirmation of testing (e.g., "Built and tested: [Agent Link]").
     - Any questions or clarifications needed.
   - **Archive** the email after completing the task.

**Note**: If unclear, ask Jimmy Chan for specifics (e.g., agent purpose, workflows, integrations).
