### **3-Step Marketing Strategy for Launching an AI Automation Service for Restaurants**

#### **1. Awareness (Month 1)**
**Target Audience:**
- Small to mid-sized restaurant owners & managers (cost-sensitive, tech-adverse but open to efficiency gains).
- Multi-unit chain operators (scalability-focused, ROI-driven).
- F&B tech buyers, hospitality consultants, and franchise advisors.
- Trade associations (e.g., National Restaurant Association, local guilds).

**Key Messaging:**
- **Pain Point:** "AI automates repetitive tasks (inventory, scheduling, customer service) so you can focus on food and guests."
- **Solution:** "Our service cuts labor costs by 20-30% while improving speed, accuracy, and customer satisfaction."
- **Proof:** "Case studies from [X] restaurants show [Y]% faster order processing and [Z]% fewer errors."

**Distribution Channels:**
- **Paid Ads:** Google Ads (target "restaurant automation," "AI for restaurants"), LinkedIn (focusing on F&B professionals).
- **Trade Shows:** Booth at **NRA Show**, **Hospitality Tech**, or local restaurant expos.
- **Partnerships:** Collaborate with POS providers (e.g., Toast, Square) or kitchen equipment brands for co-marketing.
- **Email:** Targeted outreach to restaurant owners via Association lists or LinkedIn InMail.
