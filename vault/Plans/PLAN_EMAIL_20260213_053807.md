# Plan: EMAIL_20260213_053807

### **Action Plan**

1. **What needs to be done**:
   - Respond to Jimmy Chan’s email to acknowledge receipt.
   - Clarify if you need to take immediate action on building agents or if you require guidance/resources.

2. **Priority**:
   - **High** (encourages immediate action).

3. **Next steps**:
   - **Reply** (briefly):
     > *Hi Jimmy,*
     > *This is a great call to action—can you share the specific requirements or tools needed to start building? I’ll prioritize this and get something rolling ASAP.*
     > *— [Your Name]_*
   - **Archive after confirmation** (if no further details are needed).
   - **Check Vapi Dashboard** for any linked templates or instructions (if applicable).

**Alternative**: If you lack resources/clarity, ask for:
> *"What’s the expected output or success criteria for these agents? Are there any pre-made examples or constraints we should follow?"*
