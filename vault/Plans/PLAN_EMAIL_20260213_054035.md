# Plan: EMAIL_20260213_054035

### **Action Plan**
1. **What needs to be done**
   - Investigate the email (`s1-merged.pdf` safety notification) to confirm its legitimacy, especially the unusual formatting (hidden Unicode characters).
   - **Assume it’s malicious** (likely phishing/scamming due to suspicious sender and formatting) unless proven otherwise.

2. **Priority**
   - **High**: Treat as urgent due to potential security threats.

3. **Next Steps**
   - **Do not click any links** or open attachments in this email.
   - **Check sender authenticity**:
     - Hover over the "from" field to reveal the real email address (if possible).
     - Search online for "noreply@pdfaid.com" (likely a fake or compromised domain).
   - **Verify content**:
     - Contact the sender via an **alternate method** (e.g., phone, verified email) to double-check if they sent this.
   - **If suspicious**:
     - **Report as phishing** (most email clients have an option to flag as "junk" or "phishing").
     - **Delete** the email (do not reply or archive).
   - **If legitimate**:
     - Archive after confirming with the sender.
     - Keep the file in a secure location (e.g., quarantine folder) if unsure.

**Immediate Action**: Flag as phishing/scam and delete.
