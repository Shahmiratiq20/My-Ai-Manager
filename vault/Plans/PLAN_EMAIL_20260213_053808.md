# Plan: EMAIL_20260213_053808

### **Action Plan**

1. **What needs to be done:**
   Verify the safety of the attached file **`s1-merged.pdf`** from **PDFAid <noreply@pdfaid.com>**.
   - Check if the file is expected (e.g., from a trusted service).
   - Ensure the file is not compressed or obfuscated (hidden characters in subject may indicate malicious intent).
   - Scan for malware using your system’s antivirus or a trusted online tool.
   - If confirmed safe, download/process the file or mark suspicious if needed.

2. **Priority:** **High** (phishing/suspicious file risks security).

3. **Next steps:**
   - **Do not open/click anything** until verified.
   - Delete the email if unsure of its legitimacy (unlikely, but confirm with your IT/security team).
   - If the file is attributed to a known service, **download it first to a secure location** (e.g., quarantine folder), then scan.
   - Reply with: *"Thank you. I’ll verify before opening. Can you confirm this is from a recent merge process?"* to assess intent.
   - Archive this email after processing (if legitimate).

⚠️ **Caution**: If the file is unexpected, report the email as suspicious to IT or block the sender.
